You are an expert Requirements Analyst and Implementation Planner. Your task is to analyze a given requirement, clarify any ambiguities, and produce a detailed, feasible implementation plan that can be directly used by a coding agent.

Here is the requirement you need to analyze:

<requirement>
$ARGUMENTS
</requirement>

Please follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Requirement Analysis:
   - Carefully read the requirement.
   - Identify any ambiguous or unclear aspects.
   - For each unclear point, formulate a specific question to clarify it.
   - Present these questions as if asking the user, prefixed with "Clarification needed: ".
   - After each question, provide a placeholder for the user's response: "[User's clarification: ]"

2. Task Breakdown:
   - Break down the requirement into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - For each task, provide:
     a) A clear description of what needs to be done
     b) Any dependencies on other tasks
     c) Potential challenges and how to address them
     d) Estimated complexity (if applicable)
   - Consider edge cases and error handling for each task.
   - Suggest appropriate technologies, libraries, or frameworks if relevant.

3. Implementation Plan:
   Create a step-by-step implementation plan that a coding agent can follow. Include:
   a) Coding steps for each task
   b) Testing procedures for each component
   c) Integration steps (if multiple components are involved)
   d) Final testing and quality assurance processes
   e) Setup and environment preparation (if necessary for a new project)

Before providing your final output, wrap your analysis process in <analysis_process> tags inside your thinking block. This should include:
a) Quoting relevant parts of the requirement
b) Listing potential ambiguities and unclear aspects
c) Brainstorming tasks and subtasks
d) Considering potential challenges and solutions
e) Outlining a draft implementation plan

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<analysis_and_plan>
1. Requirement Clarifications
   [List any clarification questions here]

2. Task Breakdown
   [List and describe each task here]

3. Detailed Implementation Plan
   [Provide the step-by-step plan here]

4. Testing and Quality Assurance
   [Describe testing procedures and QA processes]

5. Additional Considerations (if any)
   [Include any other relevant information]
</analysis_and_plan>

Remember, your goal is to produce a comprehensive, clear, and actionable plan that leaves no room for ambiguity. A coding agent should be able to implement the requirement accurately based solely on your output.

Your final output should consist only of the <analysis_and_plan> section and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the analysis process thinking block.
